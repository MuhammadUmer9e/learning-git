1. Create a .gitignore file (if it doesn't exist):
Navigate to the root directory of your Git repository in your command prompt or terminal. Then, use the following command to create the file:
Code

touch .gitignore
2. Add entries to the .gitignore file:
You can add lines to the .gitignore file to specify files or patterns to ignore. To ignore a specific file.
Code

    echo "filename.ext" >> .gitignore
Replace filename.ext with the actual name of the file you want to ignore. To ignore an entire directory.
Code

    echo "directoryname/" >> .gitignore
Replace directoryname/ with the name of the directory. The trailing slash is important to indicate it's a directory.
To ignore files with a specific extension:
Code

    echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
This example ignores all files ending with .log. The * acts as a wildcard.
To ignore files in a specific directory:
Code

    echo "path/to/directory/filename.ext" >> .gitignore
Example:
Let's say you want to ignore a temp.txt file and a logs directory.
Code

echo "temp.txt" >> .gitignore
echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
Important Notes:
If a file is already being tracked by Git (i.e., it has been committed previously), adding it to .gitignore will not automatically remove it from the repository. You would need to explicitly remove it from the Git index using git rm --cached filename and then commit the change.
You can open the .gitignore file with a text editor and manually add or modify the patterns as well.
.gitignore patterns support various wildcards and negation rules for more advanced ignoring. Refer to the Git documentation for details on these patterns.
