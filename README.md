command : git clone repository_address+options: <br> 

general format for website of github for cloning a respository from github to current directory on your pc <br><br>

git clone https://github.com/username/repository_name.git
<br>
username: the name of user account on github where all repositories are stored on github servers
<br>
command : git status 
<br>
used for checking for file changes such as if a file is staged for changes or not
also if the file is tracked\added by git or not 
<br> 

command : git add filename ("." for all files )
for staging the files for commiting. staging means the file is added to repos but not committed yet.  in git you first add then commit the files . commiting means that the changes are permanently added and cannot be restored like after adding. you can restore changes after adding before commiting in git by using the command git restore filename
